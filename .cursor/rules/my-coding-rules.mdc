# Your rule content

- Implement the functionality using p5js and use the p5party library for handling multiplayer.
- Always look for existing code to iterate on instead of creating new code.
- Do not drastically change the patterns before trying to iterate on existing patterns.
- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized.
- Use an object oriented programming style. The classes must not use global variables.
- Avoid having files over 500 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Separate game logic and display logic if it makes the code easier to understand and test.
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
